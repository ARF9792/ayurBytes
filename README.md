## üåü Introduction

`ayurBytes` is a Proof of Concept (POC) for an Ayurvedic Diet Management Software. This initial application demonstrates the core functionality of generating a personalized Ayurvedic diet plan based on a user's `Prakriti` (body constitution), age, and other basic health parameters.

The goal of this POC is to showcase the feasibility and potential of integrating ancient Ayurvedic wisdom with modern technology to provide personalized dietary recommendations.

## ‚ú® Features (Current POC)

* **Prakriti-Based Diet Generation:** Input your Ayurvedic Prakriti (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) to receive tailored meal suggestions.
* **Age-Group Customization:** Diet plans are adapted for different age groups (Child, Adult, Elderly).
* **Simple Input Form:** User-friendly interface to input essential patient details.
* **Basic Meal Plan Display:** Presents a generated plan for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.
* **Modern UI:** Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and aesthetically pleasing experience.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

This POC leverages a modern web development stack:

* **Frontend:**
    * [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) (React Framework)
    * [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
    * [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/)
    * [**Lucide React**](https://lucide.dev/) (for icons)
* **Backend:**
    * [**Next.js API Routes**](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) (for serverless API endpoints)
* **Data:**
    * `foods.json` (Local JSON file serving as a mock database for Ayurvedic food properties)

## üí° How it Works (Core Logic)

1.  **Patient Data Input:** The user provides their age, gender, and selected Prakriti through the frontend form.
2.  **API Call:** This data is sent to a Next.js API route.
3.  **Food Filtering:** The API filters the `foods.json` database based on:
    * **Prakriti Compatibility:** Foods are selected or excluded based on their `Virya` (potency) and `Guna` (qualities) to balance the chosen Prakriti.
    * **Age Suitability:** Further refinement ensures foods are appropriate for the specified age group (e.g., easier-to-digest foods for children/elderly).
4.  **Meal Assembly:** A simple algorithm then attempts to select diverse foods for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner from the filtered list.
5.  **Diet Plan Display:** The generated diet plan is returned to the frontend and displayed to the user.
