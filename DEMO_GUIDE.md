## üéØ Judges' Likely Questions & Answers

**Q: How is this different from FitnessPal or HealthifyMe?**
A: Those are generic calorie counters. We combine Ayurvedic wisdom (Prakriti, seasonal awareness, Virya properties) with modern tech. Plus, we support 7 Indian languages and have allergen safety filtering.

**Q: How accurate are the nutritional calculations?**
A: We use USDA food database values. Each food has verified protein/carbs/fat/fiber. Weekly plans calculate averages and track variety to ensure balanced nutrition.

**Q: Can this scale to millions of users?**
A: Yes - it's built on Next.js which is production-ready. We use static generation where possible, API routes are stateless, and we can add caching/CDN easily.

**Q: What about privacy and data security?**
A: All data is stored locally in browser. No server-side storage of personal info. Users control their data completely.

**Q: How do you validate Ayurvedic principles?**
A: Our food database includes authentic Ayurvedic properties (Virya, Prakriti balance). We consulted Ayurvedic texts and practitioners for guidelines.

## üé§ Opening Hook (Memorize This)

- Balances Vata with grounding foods

That's the power of tradition + technology."
