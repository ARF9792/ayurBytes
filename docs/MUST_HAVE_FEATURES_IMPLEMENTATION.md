## 🚀 Next Steps (Remaining Must-Haves)

### 3. Expanded Food Database
- Currently ~50 items in `data/foods.json`
- **Target:** 300-500 items for POC (8,000+ for production)
- **TODO:** Add nutritional data to existing foods
- **TODO:** Add regional Indian foods (North, South, East, West)
- **TODO:** Add food search and filter functionality

### 4. Recipe-Based Diet Charts
- **TODO:** Create `Recipe` type (ingredients, instructions, nutrition)
- **TODO:** Recipe management component
- **TODO:** Auto-calculate nutrition from ingredients
- **TODO:** Add 20-30 sample Ayurvedic recipes

### 5. Export & Print Functionality
- **TODO:** Install `react-pdf` or `jsPDF`
- **TODO:** Create printable diet chart template
- **TODO:** PDF generation with patient details + diet plan + guidelines
- **TODO:** Download and share options

---

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Immediate Priority:** Expand food database with nutritional data
2. **Quick Win:** Add PDF export for professional presentation
3. **Nice to Have:** Recipe management system
4. **Future:** Authentication and cloud database (Supabase/Firebase)
